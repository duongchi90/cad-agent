# CAD Agent Status

## Status vocabulary

- **Verified:** the named command ran successfully on the named commit and
  environment.
- **Partially verified:** deterministic coverage passed, but a required private
  data or AutoCAD Mechanical gate has not run on the same candidate.
- **Unverified:** no current reproducible evidence supports the claim.
- **NOT RUN:** the gate was intentionally not executed; this is never a pass.

## Supported release environment

- Windows
- Python 3.11
- AutoCAD Mechanical 2027
- Tesseract 5.4.0.20240606

## Authoritative verification

After bootstrap, run `.\scripts\verify.ps1`. It runs the offline gate and
collects unavailable-state probes for `real_data` and `autocad_mechanical` as explicit
`SKIP` results with prerequisites removed. A real private-data or live AutoCAD
Mechanical gate that was not separately executed remains `NOT RUN`.

## Pre-foundation baseline

| State | Date | Commit | Environment | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Verified | 2026-07-22 | `908d016` | Windows, bundled Python 3.12.13, Tesseract 5.4.0.20240606 | `python -m pytest primitive_ir_lib/tests semantic_ir_lib/tests dxf_builder_lib/tests mcp_integration_lib/tests agent_lib/tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` | `255 passed, 11 skipped, 3 warnings` |

This baseline demonstrates that the existing core is worth preserving. It is
not the Python 3.11 foundation certificate because seven solver tests were among
the skips and the run used Python 3.12.

## Current module status

| Area | State | Evidence and limit |
|---|---|---|
| Primitive IR | Partially verified | Final Python 3.11 offline gate passed with zero skips; approved private `real_data` execution was NOT RUN and its unavailable-state probe was SKIP. |
| Semantic IR | Verified | Final Python 3.11 offline gate passed with `python-solvespace` installed and zero offline skips. |
| DXF build/review/repair | Verified | Final Python 3.11 offline DXF tests passed; production AutoCAD Mechanical mutation is outside this state. |
| MCP/File IPC | Partially verified | Offline/fake IPC tests passed; current AutoCAD Mechanical 2027 live evidence is recorded after the renamed `autocad_mechanical` gate runs. |
| Agent advice/audit | Partially verified | Offline tests passed; `run_agent()` is non-mutating, but the current run/demo entry points auto-apply reports and are not approved production mutation paths. |
| Reproducible foundation | Verified | See the Foundation certificate and `docs/reviews/2026-07-22-reproducible-foundation.md`. |
| Thin image orchestration CLI | Verified | `cad_agent` run/resume regression tests and the full Python 3.11 offline gate passed on `8410712f0c7c23f707acc1b251620712806be971`; it emits staged DXF only and does not invoke live AutoCAD or Agent mutation. |

## Known production gates

- Calibration may be auto-accepted only with at least two independent
  candidates and median relative error at most 3 percent. Current production
  callers must opt into consensus and retain human approval for unverified
  scale.
- Private drawing benchmarks remain outside Git and are addressed by SHA-256.
- AutoCAD Mechanical mutation requires backup, human approval, live review, repair, and
  a second review.

## Next slice

Normalize the approved private real-data benchmark and harden algorithms only
against fresh benchmark evidence. The final Windows/AutoCAD Mechanical 2027 production
review-repair loop remains after that slice.

## Thin vertical-slice CLI evidence

- State: **Verified**
- Date: `2026-07-22`
- Implementation Head SHA: `8410712f0c7c23f707acc1b251620712806be971`
- Design and plan: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-vertical-slice-cli-design.md`; `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-22-vertical-slice-cli.md`
- Focused command: `& '.\.venv-py311\Scripts\python.exe' -m pytest tests\test_cad_agent_cli.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` → `3 passed`
- Authoritative command: `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\verify.ps1` → exit `0`
- Offline JUnit: `tests=295; failures=0; errors=0; skipped=0`
- `real_data`: unavailable-state probe `SKIP` (`tests=1; skipped=1`); approved private run `NOT RUN`
- `autocad_lt`: historical unavailable-state probe `SKIP` (`tests=4; skipped=4`); live session run `NOT RUN` at this pre-target-change commit
- Remaining risk: this image-only orchestrator emits a staged DXF and does not perform AutoCAD Mechanical mutation; PDF orchestration remains with `primitive_ir_lib.run_pdf`.

## Historical File IPC evidence before the AutoCAD Mechanical target change

- State: **Partially verified**
- Date: `2026-07-22`
- Head SHA: `52b92885698827c36984f02e8461f4e18de6072c`
- Command: `CAD_AGENT_FILE_IPC=1`, AutoCAD HWND `393650`, and the locally loaded dispatcher; `& '.\.venv-py311\Scripts\python.exe' -m pytest -m autocad_lt -ra -p no:cacheprovider`
- Result: `4 passed, 296 deselected` in `69.52s`; the run covered active-document access, primitive live review/repair, beam INSERT attribute repair, and five remaining component INSERT repairs.
- Session: AutoCAD Mechanical 2027, process `acad.exe`, HWND `393650`.
- Safety: all smoke DXFs were newly created under `C:\temp`; no production drawing was saved or modified.
- Limit: the then-current marker was `autocad_lt`, so this evidence predates the AutoCAD Mechanical target contract and is retained as historical context only.
